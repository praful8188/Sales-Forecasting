This project is focused on developing a predictive model for sales forecasting, leveraging historical sales data, seasonal patterns, and external factors. Implemented in Python, the project is designed to be developed and run within Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The repository is organized with directories for source code (src/), Jupyter notebooks (notebooks/), datasets (data/), trained models (models/), and results (results/). To set up the project, clone the repository, create a virtual environment, install dependencies from requirements.txt, and open the project in VS Code. The data includes key fields such as Date, Sales, Store, Promotion, and Holiday, stored in CSV files within the data/ directory. After setting up, you can run the Jupyter notebooks in VS Code for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and initial model testing.
